# Landing Page Project

Hello guys!

This is my solution for the Udacity Landing Page Project. We were provided with a starter project which has some HTML and CSS styling. Our task was to design it with HTML, CSS, but primarily JavaScript in a way to make it interactive.

## Navbar

At first I designed a navbar which create itself dynamically to the number of sections in the HTML code. 
The navbar itself adds a new link if I add a new section in the HTML.

## Active Section

In the following part I decided to use the IntersectionObserver API to see which part of the landing page is in the viewport. The section in viewport will be set active by JavaScript.

## Back to Top Button

The back to top button will display on the bottom right if you scroll down. You can jump back to top whereever you are on the page.
